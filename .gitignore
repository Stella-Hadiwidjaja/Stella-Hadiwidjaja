# .DS_Store is a file that is automatically created by the macOS operating system. It stands for "Desktop Services Store." This file is used to store custom attributes of a folder, such as the position of icons, view settings, and other metadata.The .DS_Store file is created in each directory of a macOS file system, including directories within Git repositories. However, it is generally not necessary or desired to include these files in version control. Therefore, it is common to add .DS_Store to the .gitignore file to exclude them from being tracked by Git. By ignoring .DS_Store files, you can prevent them from cluttering your Git repository and avoid unnecessary changes when working with a team or sharing your code.

# A .pyc file is a compiled bytecode file generated by Python when you run a Python script or module. It stands for "Python Compiled" file. The purpose of .pyc files is to improve the execution speed of Python programs by precompiling the source code into a format that can be executed more efficiently by the Python interpreter. In general, it is not necessary to commit .pyc files to your Git repository. These files are generated automatically and can be regenerated whenever needed. Including them in your repository can lead to unnecessary bloating of the repository size and can cause conflicts when collaborating with others. To exclude .pyc files from being committed, you can add the following pattern to your .gitignore file:
*.pyc
